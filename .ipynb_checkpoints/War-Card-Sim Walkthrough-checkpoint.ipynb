    "This simulation and walkthrough is a learning project for me to: \n",
    "* Work with python some more\n",
    "* Test some basic python analytics and graphing packages\n",
    "* Use Jupyter/IPython notebooks\n",
    "* Keep everything organized with git and publishing on github.\n",
    "* Show how random the game of 'War' is if you didn't already know...\n",

    "First lets set up our simulation for 2 players to play 100,000 games of war and run the simulation"
